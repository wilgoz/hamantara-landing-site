    question: "How do ultrafiltration membrane filters work?",
    answer:
      "Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes work by using pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane with extremely small pores (0.02 micron), effectively removing bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants while allowing minerals and beneficial elements to pass through. This provides clean, safe water without removing the natural minerals your body needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the filters last before needing replacement?",
    answer:
      "Our UF membrane filters typically last ~3-10 years without requiring replacements depending on usage, water quality and model used.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do I need a professional to install your water filtration systems?",
    answer:
      "While our home and kitchen systems are designed for easy DIY installation with clear instructions, we recommend professional installation for whole-house systems to ensure optimal performance. We can arrange installation services through our network of certified technicians.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are your emergency water filtration units portable?",
    answer:
      "Yes, our emergency water filtration units are designed to be lightweight, compact, and easily transportable. They can be quickly deployed in disaster situations and don't require electricity to operate, making them ideal for emergency preparedness and disaster relief.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer maintenance services for your filtration systems?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we offer comprehensive maintenance plans and services for all our filtration systems. Our technicians can perform regular check-ups, filter replacements, and system optimizations to ensure your water filtration system continues to deliver the highest quality water.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can your filters remove specific contaminants like lead or chlorine?",
    answer:
      "Our advanced filtration systems use multiple filtration stages designed to target specific contaminants. While UF membranes excel at removing biological contaminants, our comprehensive systems also include activated carbon and other media to remove chemical contaminants like chlorine, lead, and others based on your specific needs.",
  },
